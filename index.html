I'm Your Emotional Support Animal
What counts as an emotional support animal?
… Can you just say I’m your emotional support animal?
</p>
 <p> 
I'm Your Emotional Support Animal
Why are people against emotional support animals?
Are mental illnesses
All Woke, No Joke?
</p>
<p>  
I'm Your Emotional Support Animal
I swear, as long as I'm in the same room with you I'm happy.

<p>  
I'm Your Emotional Support Animal
If it is at work or in another public space, then legally, no.
